# NOTE(aznashwan): the base for the manager image is the Suse Linux Enterprise
# Base Container Image (SLE BCE) Service Pack 5 which ships with Linux 5.14,
# and is thus most comparable to 22.04:
# https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-manager/blob/v1.6.2/package/Dockerfile#L1

  # NOTE(aznashwan): the longhorn binary is built within a Docker container
  # which is set up by Rancher's Dapper tool: https://github.com/rancher/dapper
  # The setup steps for the build container are contained within this Dockerfile:
  # https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-manager/blob/v1.6.2/Dockerfile.dapper
  # The Makefile targets are just the scripts found in the scripts/ directory which
  # are executed within the Dapper build container:

      # NOTE(claudiub): The original longhorn-manager image doesn't have an entrypoint, only a CMD.
      # This means that when the image is launched, it will run the CMD directly. Basically, the
      # CMD is the ENTRYPOINT (binary + arguments). That works fine with the current deployments.
      #
      # longhorn-manager will create the daemonset.apps/longhorn-csi-plugin, which will
      # have a longhorn-manager container, which doesn't override the entrypoint, only the
      # args (aka CMD).
      # But in our rock scenario, Pebble is the entrypoint, which will get those arguments and pass them
      # on onto the service defined above. This results in an invalid command being run, something like:
      # longhorn-manager -d daemon longhorn-manager -d csi --nodeid=...
      #
      # This patch updates the mentioned container args to command, overriding the Pebble entrypoint,
      # avoiding this problem.
